Python - More Classes and Objects

Rectangle tasks (0..9): properties, area/perimeter, __str__/__repr__,
instance deletion, class attributes (number_of_instances, print_symbol),
staticmethod/classmethod (bigger_or_equal, square).
Each module/class/method has a docstring. Files are executable and PEP8-compliant.
